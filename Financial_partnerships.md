### A debt partner is assessing your business loan book performance. What information would you expect the partner to asses during its due diligence?

As I understand, a debt partner should look for key indicators to find out whether my business is worth supporting or not. 
This indicators have to do with efficiency of my lending team and how they manage their pipeline.
Some kpi I found while doing research are: 
+ Pull Through Rate, which is the rate between total funded loans and the number of applications.
+ Abandoned Loan Rate, which is the percentaje of loan applications that are not completed.
+ Write-offs, which is the number of loans rules as uncollectable
+ Number of loans in arrears, considered when a borrower has missed any repayments.


### Your business is raising debt to finance its loan book. What factors would you consider important in choosing a suitable debt partner?

+ Interest rates
+ Experience of my partner, as he/she may have helpful insight in the industry.
+ Repayment terms.
+ Network of my partner, in case I need recomendations or other partners to raise more debt.
