This directory contains the files I used to answer the Product/Analyst homework.

The first query, regarding the exercise Joining Tables can be found in LoansWithdrawn.txt

The rest of the queries, corresponding to the Aggregation exercises:
- number of loans per month (1)
- total `amount` of all loans per month (2)
- average amount of each loan per month (3)
- smallest loan size per month (4)
- largest loan size per month (5)

can be found on Aggregate_1.txt, Aggregation_2.txt,... correspondingly.

For the Data Analysis resolution there is a jupyter notebook file called Data_Analysis.ypynb along with a Data_Analysis.md, located inside the Data_Analysis file.

For the Financial partnerships there is a file called Financial_partnerships.md

This work, queries, and analysis were all made by Luis Felipe Alva.
